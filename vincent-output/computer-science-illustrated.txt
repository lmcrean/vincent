Explain two characteristics you would look for in a hashing algorithm for this purpose.;Low chance of collision (i.e. different inputs giving same output) to reduce risk of different files being marked as the same. Quick to calculate as lots of files need to be hashed/needs to be quicker than a bitwise comparison to make it worthwhile.;<img src='card-003.png'>
After running the program a user finds that they still have apparent duplicates of some of their images. Explain why these apparent duplicates might still be present.;Hashing works on the data/bits and so two images may appear the same but not be identical at a bit level. This could be because they are different file types / different sizes. Even the change of a single bit may result in a completely different hash.;<img src='card-004.png'>
State a data structure that would be suited to represent the data above.;Graph.;<img src='card-005.png'>
Describe what is meant by a primary key.;A field that has a unique value/a unique identifier for every record in that table.;<img src='card-006.png'>
Write an SQL query that finds the name and presenter of all videos on the Topic of "The CPU".;SELECT VideoName, Presenter FROM Video WHERE Topic="The CPU".;<img src='card-007.png'>
Lizard is a class. Describe what is meant by a class.;A template defining methods and attributes used to make objects.;<img src='card-008.png'>
Identify an attribute in the Lizard class.;Speed/mass/size.;<img src='card-009.png'>
Describe what is meant by the term inheritance.;Inheritance is when a class takes on the methods and attributes of a parent class. The inheriting class may override some of these methods/attributes and may have additional extra methods and attributes of its own.;<img src='card-010.png'>
The game uses a 2D graphics library. Explain why a linker would need to be used after compilation.;The user running the program will not necessarily have the library installed on their machine therefore the relevant code needs to be included within the final executable - it is the job of the linker to combine this code.;<img src='card-011.png'>
State what type of translator program would be needed to convert the code above into machine code.;An assembler.;<img src='card-012.png'>
Describe a sensor that the device might include to help monitor calories burnt.;Altimeter when the wearer is ascending/descending. Accelerometer measure forces on device when it moves. Gyroscope to measure if wearer turns.;<img src='card-013.png'>
The device stores its data on flash memory. Explain why flash storage would be more appropriate than a magnetic hard drive for this device.;Device is likely to undergo lots of sudden movement magnetic hard drives can be susceptible to damage if moved quickly due to the head coming into contact with the platter whereas flash memory has no moving parts and so is not affected.;<img src='card-014.png'>
State which bitwise manipulation on 00010101 would have achieved the same result as the calculation on part (a).;Shift left.;<img src='card-015.png'>
Convert the denary number -52 into an 8-bit binary number using two's complement.;11001100;<img src='card-016.png'>
Describe why two's complement may be preferable to sign and magnitude.;It is not easily possible to carry out calculations using sign and magnitude whereas they will work with two's complement.;<img src='card-017.png'>
Demonstrate subtraction in binary using 8-bit two's complement using the equivalent of the denary calculation 47-23. You must show all working.;23 in binary 00010111 -23 2's complement 11101001 47 in binary 00101111 add them together 00011000;<img src='card-018.png'>
Describe two functions an operating system might be expected to carry out on the console.;Provide a user interface for the user to load games etc. Control hardware such as graphics card, games controllers etc.;<img src='card-019.png'>
Linux is open-source. Explain how Linux being open-source would benefit the games company.;This means that a lot of the core functionality they need is already available so the company just has to make amendments/additions specific to their system saving time and money.;<img src='card-020.png'>
As well as a CPU the console contains a GPU for 3D graphics. Explain why a GPU is more suitable than a CPU for this task.;CPUs are general purpose processors whereas GPUs are designed specifically for graphics. And so likely to have built in circuitry/instructions for common graphics operations. GPUs are able to perform an instruction on multiple pieces of data at one time often we want to do this when processing graphics (e.g. transforming points in a polygon or shading pixels) which means it can perform transformations to onscreen graphics quicker than a CPU.;<img src='card-021.png'>
Describe what is meant by a LAN.;A group of computers/devices connected over a small geographical area. The infrastructure is usually owned by the network owner.;<img src='card-022.png'>
TCP/IP uses packet switching. Explain what is meant by packet switching.;Data is split into chunks called packets which have labels including address being sent to and order. Each packet is sent on the most convenient/avoidable route meaning they may arrive in a different order to which they were sent. Once packets arrive at receiver they are reordered.;<img src='card-023.png'>
Write a logic expression for S in terms of A and B.;S=A XOR B;<img src='card-024.png'>
Write a logic expression for C in terms of A and B.;C=A AND B;<img src='card-025.png'>
Using the rules for manipulating Boolean expressions simplify the following: A∧B ∨ A∧(B∨C) ∨ B∧(B∨C);B ∨ A∧C;<img src='card-026.png'>
Describe one advantage of storing the CSS in an external file rather than it being embedded within HTML files.;Content and formatting are kept separate. Changes can be made to the external style sheet and affect the whole site saving time and ensuring consistency.;<img src='card-027.png'>
Explain why it is important to check the email address with JavaScript and again when it reaches the server.;The JavaScript check is carried out client-side/in browser meaning address can be checked and stopped prior to reaching server reducing unnecessary load on the server. JavaScript can, however, be amended and circumvented therefore address must be checked at the server to ensure this has not happened.;<img src='card-028.png'>
Identify one reason why this structure would not be suitable.;Many to Many relationships are not allowed/in 3NF.;<img src='card-029.png'>
Describe a difference between an array and a linked list.;A linked list is a dynamic data structure whereas an array is static. An array can have any element accessed directly (i.e. random access) whereas a linked list needs to be traversed until the desired element is found.;<img src='card-030.png'>
Identify an instruction in the Little Man Computer program shown in Fig.2 that would cause the PC to change in a different way.;BRA/BRP.;<img src='card-031.png'>
State which register the contents of the PC would be copied to in order for the processor to access the next instruction.;Memory Address Register (MAR).;<img src='card-032.png'>
